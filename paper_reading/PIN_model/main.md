论文精读之 Is Information Risk a Determinant of Asset Returns ?

# 信息风险是资产回报的决定因素之一吗?

## 摘要

本文将探讨基于信息的交易是如何影响资产回报的.
以私有信息对证券资产回报的影响为例, 我们给出了
通过使用市场微观架构模型, 我们给出了对  概率的测量,

使用1983到1988年的NYSE上市股票的数据

我们还将这一推定吸收进了Fama Fraench资产定价框架,

我们得到的主要结论是, 信息确实影响了资产价格.
对于两只股票, 基于消息的交易行为概率差距达到10%时, 他们的期望收益的差距也打到了每年2.5%.

资产定价是帮助我们理解经济体的财富流动的基石.
这一重要的理论中心
资产交易所在的市场的特性.

而市场微观架构则着眼于交易行为如何影响了交易价格.

其中大量文献探讨了某个信息被价格所吸收的过程,
微观架构的文献提供了   价格  波动率  这两大资产定价过程中的.

但是, 提供了对于私有信息的范畴的明确推定.
相关文献指出了私有信息与资产的报价
但是稍微明确探讨私有信息是如何实际的影响到了资产定价的基本原理.

如果某个资产有着更高的可能性存在
那么这是否会影响到其对应的期望收益呢?
传统的资产定价方法并不认可这种影响,
这些模型基于资产已经被"有效地"定价了, 因此任何信息都以包含在内, 也就无需考虑其影响了.
但是, 这种对于"有效"的观点是静态的.如果资产价格被不断修正, 以反映新的消息, 那么有效性就是一个过程, 任何时间点上,资产价格如何变得有效都要与资产回报同时考虑.

过往的文献已经以不同方法证明了股票回报可能取决于交易过程. Amihud and Mendelson (1986)可谓是这一观点的最直接的研究, 他们讨论了流动性是否应该被定价. 他们提出投资者试图最大化的是期望回报减去交易成本, 而交易成本的最简单的指标就是买卖价差.均衡状态下,投资者将对价差大的资产有着更高的回报期望. Amihud and Mendelson
(1986, 1989) 和 Eleswarapu (1997) 提出了这一流动性假设的经验性证据.更多的研究通过其他的流动性指标也支持这一观点, 例如 Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996), Amihud, Men-
delson, and Lauterbach (1997), Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998),
Datar, Naik, and Radcliffe (1998), 和 Amihud (2000).




Certainly, part of the difficulty in resolving this issue is simply
that transactions costs, however measured, are often quite small.
研究的难点之一是测量道德交易成本通常都特别小.

While iden-tifying illiquidity with transactions costs seems sensible, finding these li-quidity effects among the noise in asset returns need not be an easy task.

Our focus in this paper is on showing empirically that a different aspect of
the trading and price discovery process-private information-affects cross-
sectional asset returns. We first present a simple example to provide the
intuition for why the existence of private information should affect stock
returns.' The importance of this information effect is then an empirical ques-
tion.


However, this question is difficult to answer because the extent of pri-
vate information is not directly observable.

To deal with this problem, we
use a structural market microstructure model to generate a measure of the
probability of information-based trading (PIN) in individual stocks.

We then
estimate this measure using high-frequency data for NYSE-listed stocks for
the period 1983 to 1998.

The resulting estimates are a time series of indi-
vidual stock probabilities of information-based trading for a very large cross

We present in this paper a brief example of this cross-sectional
effect.

section of stocks. We investigate whether these information probabilities af-
fect cross-sectional asset returns by incorporating our estimates into a Fama
and French (1992) asset pricing framework.
Our main result is that information does affect asset prices: Stocks with higher
probabilities of information-based trading have higher rates of return. In-
deed, we find that a difference of 10 percentage points in PIN between two stocks
leads to a difference in their expected returns of 2.5 percent per year. The mag-
nitude, and statistical significance, of this effect provides strong support for
the premise that information affects asset-pricing fundamentals.
Our focus on the role of information in asset pricing is related to several
recent papers. In a companion theoretical paper, Easley and O'Hara (2000)
develop a multiasset rational expectations equilibrium model in which stocks
have differing levels of public and private information. In equilibrium, un-
informed traders require compensation to hold stocks with greater private
information, resulting in cross-sectional differences in returns. Admati (1985)
generalized Grossman and Stiglitz's (1980) analysis of partially revealing
rational expectations equilibrium to multiple assets and showed how indi-
viduals face differing risk-return trade-offs when differential information is
not fully revealed in equilibrium. Wang (1993) provides an intertemporal
asset-pricing model in which traders can invest in a riskless asset and a
risky asset. In this model, the presence of traders with superior information
induces an adverse selection problem, as uninformed traders demand a pre-
mium for the risk of trading with informed traders. However, trading by the
informed investors also makes prices more informative, thereby reducing
uncertainty. These two effects go in opposite directions, and their overall
effect on asset returns is ambiguous. Because this model allows only one
risky asset, it is not clear how, if at all, information would affect cross-
sectional returns. Jones and Slezak (1999) also develop a theoretical model
allowing for asymmetric information to affect asset returns. Their model
relies on changes in the variance of news and liquidity shocks over time to
differentially affect agents' portfolio holdings, thereby influencing asset re-
turns. These theoretical papers suggest that asymmetric information can
affect asset returns, the issue of interest in this paper.
